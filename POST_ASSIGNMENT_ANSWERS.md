## Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

- **Next.js for Frontend:** Chose Next.js for its robust features, including server-side rendering and static site generation, which improve performance and SEO.
- **Node.js/Express for Backend:** Used Node.js and Express due to their non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is suitable for building scalable network applications.
- **MongoDB for Database:** Selected MongoDB for its flexibility in handling unstructured data and ease of integration with Node.js.
- **Docker for Containerization:** Containerized the application using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments and simplify deployment.

## How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets.

- **Coding:** 6 hours
  - Frontend Development: 3.5 hours
  - Backend Development: 1.5 hours
  - Database Integration: 1 hour
- **Debugging and Testing:** 1 hours
- **Documentation:** 1 hour
- **Total:** 8 hours

## If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

- Focus on setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline early to automate testing and deployment processes, which would save time and reduce manual effort during the later stages of the project.


## Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

- Yes, this assignment provided a comprehensive platform to demonstrate my skills in full-stack development, particularly in integrating modern frontend and backend technologies, implementing functional user features, and deploying a scalable application using Docker. However, my proficiency in TypeScript was not fully demonstrated as I opted not to use it to meet the assignment deadline. Given more time, I would integrate TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability.

## Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

- **TypeScript:** I am highly proficient in TypeScript and typically use it to leverage strong typing for improved code quality and maintainability.
- **GraphQL:** While the project used REST APIs, I also have extensive experience with GraphQL, which could further optimize data fetching and enhance client-server interactions.
- **Performance Optimization:** Skills in optimizing web application performance through techniques such as code splitting, lazy loading, and advanced caching strategies.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Experience in designing and implementing microservices architectures, which can further enhance the scalability and maintainability of large applications.
