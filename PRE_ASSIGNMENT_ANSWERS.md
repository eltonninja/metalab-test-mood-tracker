## What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- **Integration and Data Consistency:** Ensuring smooth integration between the Next.js frontend and the Node.js/Express backend while maintaining data consistency in MongoDB.
- **User Authentication and Security:** Although user authentication is not implemented in this version, it remains a critical area of risk if added in the future, particularly regarding secure data handling.
- **Scalability:** Ensuring that the application can handle increasing loads, particularly if the mood tracker app gains a large user base. This includes handling concurrent users, database scaling, and efficient API responses.

## What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- **Enhanced User Interface:** Improve the user interface by adding more interactive and visually appealing components such as charts for mood trends and a calendar view for better visualization of mood entries.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure that the app is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across different devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Integrate more advanced analytics features to provide users with deeper insights into their mood patterns over time.

## List two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

1. **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow users to securely log in and manage their mood data.
2. **Social Sharing and Community Support:** Allow users to share their mood updates with friends or within a community to foster support and engagement.
3. **Personalized Recommendations:** Provide users with personalized suggestions based on their mood trends, such as relaxation techniques, motivational quotes, or professional help resources.

## Are there any clarifying questions you would ask? If you're able to make assumptions about these and continue, please record and share your assumptions.

### Clarifying Questions:
- Are there any specific user roles and permissions required (e.g., admin vs. regular user)?
- Is there a preference for any specific charting library or visualization tool?

### Assumptions:
- The app will have a single user role for now, with potential for role-based access in the future.
- The initial version will be in English, with localization considered for future updates.
- I will use a popular charting library like rechart.js or D3.js for visualizations.

### Note on TypeScript:
Although I am proficient in TypeScript and typically prefer using it for its strong typing and improved code quality, I decided not to use it in this project to meet the assignment deadline. If given more time, I would integrate TypeScript to enhance the maintainability and robustness of the codebase.
